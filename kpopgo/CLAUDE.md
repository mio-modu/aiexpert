# KPOPGO — working rules

Step-by-step guides for international K-pop fans buying tickets, memberships and
albums from outside Korea. English is canonical. Production domain is
`kpopgo.app`.

Read this before changing anything. Most of what follows is a constraint that
looks arbitrary until it is violated, and then costs the site something it
cannot buy back.

## The three rules that are not negotiable

**No idol photographs, likenesses, or AI-generated faces.** Not one, anywhere.
Agencies enforce portrait rights aggressively, and a takedown can reach the
AdSense account as well as the page. Every figure on the site is an anonymous
backlit silhouette — the language of a concert poster — and every object was
drawn or rendered for this site. Generating an idol's face rather than copying
a photograph does not help: copyright and the right of publicity are separate
rights, and the second one is the problem.

**No identity-check workarounds.** Where a platform requires Korean 본인인증 we
say so and describe the official routes open to overseas fans. We do not
explain how to get around a verification, borrow a Korean number, or use
someone else's membership. A reader who follows that advice loses their order;
a site that gives it loses the only thing it sells.

**Nothing is marked verified until a person has walked it.** Every guide in
`content/guides.ts` carries `status`, `lastVerified`, `scope` and `sources`,
and `status: "draft"` renders a visible banner saying nobody has been through
the flow yet. All five are drafts today and that is accurate. The entire
premise is being more accurate than the stale guides that currently rank, so
claiming a verification that did not happen makes us one of them.

## Why this site exists

The English guides ranking for "how to buy K-pop concert tickets" describe a
ticketing site that has since been renamed, under rules that have since
changed:

| What changed | When |
| --- | --- |
| Interpark Ticket → NOL Ticket | April 2025 |
| interpark Global → **NOL World** | 1 December 2025 |
| Revised Performances Act in effect | 28 August 2025 |

The schedule and profile niches are taken — Billboard and Soompi run tour
lists, and there are city-level specialists. The *procedure* niche is not: the
competition there is travel-agency blogs and a prepaid-card company's content
marketing. That is a winnable set, and it is why the site is a how-to and not
a wiki.

## Design

Built against the webdesign-style system, mixing codes per section rather than
committing to one across the whole site:

| Section | Code |
| --- | --- |
| Home hero, crowd band | **T09 영화 같은 한 장면** — 빛은 뒤에서 |
| Numbers, proof blocks | **T20 숫자로 증명하기** |
| Objects, cards | **T13 보송한 3D 사물** — 반짝임 금지 |
| Booking screens | **T21 화면 캡처 겹치기** — 진짜 데이터만 |

T09 and T13 conflict on purpose and both sit in the DEPTH group, so they read
as one set. T17 is deliberately unused: its no-gradient rule would make the
hero's backlit glow impossible.

Palette is obangsaek-derived rather than the usual cream-and-terracotta:
주朱 vermilion, 군청 indigo, 백 bone, 흑 ink. The verification badge is a 인장
seal, because a seal is a mark of authentication and that is the product.
Light theme is the resting state; the dark theme is complete, and the
cinematic bands stay dark in both because they are photographs.

Type: Archivo (wide poster display), Gothic A1 and Black Han Sans (Hangul),
JetBrains Mono (dates, platform codes, step timings).

## Hangul is content, not ornament

Every Korean word on the site is one a fan meets on a real booking screen —
본인인증, 선예매, 결제 — and `/words` exists to teach exactly those. Do not add
Hangul as decoration, and do not translate the site into Korean: the paying
audience is Tier-1 English speakers, there is no Korean-language demand for a
guide to buying Korean tickets, and machine translation would put the legal and
verification wording at risk. Later languages get hand-reviewed translations.

## Artwork

`content/artwork.ts` holds every piece's file name, dimensions, alt text and
its generation brief. `<Artwork>` checks for the file at build time and falls
back to the drawn SVG in `components/Objects.tsx` when it is missing, so the
site is complete with zero image assets and gets richer as renders land.

Cut-outs ship with **no baked shadow** — a shadow the render chose cannot
follow the theme. They are hard silhouettes and `.art-drop` draws the shadow
from `--cast-soft`. Full-bleed frames pass `drop={false}`.

Export cut-outs as **PNG with alpha**. Recovering alpha from a flattened
checkerboard works often enough to try and not often enough to rely on — two of
the six failed that way and are still on their fallbacks.

## Advertising

Slots live in `components/AdSlot.tsx` and render nothing until their ids are
set, so the site looks finished through the weeks before approval. Rules:

- **Reserve the height.** An ad that pushes the article down is a layout
  shift, and Google ranks on it. On a site whose only channel is search, an
  unreserved slot spends search position to buy impressions.
- **Label every unit.** On a page whose product is trust, an ad that reads as
  a recommendation costs more than it earns.
- At most two per page, never above the fold, never between a step and its
  warning.

Do not apply for AdSense before the guides are verified and there is real
search data — a rejection carries a cooldown that makes a premature
application the slower path.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
npm run build
npm run typecheck
```

Screenshots in this container use the preinstalled browser; do not run
`playwright install`:

```js
chromium.launch({
  executablePath: "/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome",
  args: ["--no-sandbox"],
})
```

## Before pushing

- `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` both clean
- Check both themes and phone width — the hero headline must stay legible over
  the scrim, and nothing may scroll sideways
- Any new claim carries a source and a date
